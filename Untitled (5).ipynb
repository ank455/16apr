    "AdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, is one of the earliest and most well-known boosting algorithms in machine learning. It is used for binary classification tasks although it can be extended to multiclass classification as well. AdaBoost works by combining multiple weak learners into a single strong classifier. The core idea behind AdaBoost is to give more weight to the data points that are misclassified by the previous weak learners, allowing the algorithm to focus on the most challenging examples.\n",
